    """The orchestrator's conduct, brought by its mode state to every state above it: a stop is refused while work this agent sent out waits clocked out, naming each worker, but for one it awaits, the worker itself or a run in its worktree, and once, with journal worker wait, while its workers are only still out; a stop carries the status of every started plan, names a started plan that has not moved while another moves, and a run of the whole suite that failed after merges; the tick asks for the priorities at a phase start and every so many minutes, names the blocked and paused tasks standing still and a started plan with many open tasks and no order; a release is refused unless the orchestrator may release, a full set of places names the oldest work to check, a wait written in words is named; a queued task that unblocks others is named, and a single task dispatched or sent while others of its plan wait to be handed out is named once with the queue that takes them; and a merged worker whose model did not fit its work, or that spent much on work of a settled shape, is named."""
