# Checks

A check is a script that passes or fails, run by hand or every so many minutes. A failure is reported to you;
the next pass clears it.

- `journal check create "<title>" --command "<shell>" --every <minutes> --brief "<what it checks and what a failure means>"`;
  `--every 0` runs by hand only.
- `journal check run <n>` runs it now and prints the tail on failure. `journal check list` shows how each last went.
- `journal check stop <n>` force stops a running check: its command ends at once, and the run is recorded as stopped,
  neither passed nor failed, so nothing is reported and it can be run again.
- `journal check edit <n> [--title] [--command] [--brief] [--every]` changes the fields you name on a check and leaves the rest.
- `journal check remove <n>` retires a check: it runs no more and leaves the list, and a task or plan that waited on it
  alone opens again.
- When a check fails, fix what it found before anything else, then run it again.
- A check shows its progress from what it prints: a count such as `120/983`, test dots, or a percent. It may write
  a report to the file named by `$JOURNAL_REPORT`: `{"title", "summary", "findings": [{"name", "file", "line", "where",
  "text", "group"}]}`; the page lists its findings under the check, grouped, each opening its file at its line.
