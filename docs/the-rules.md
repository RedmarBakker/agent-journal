# The rules: every state and every line, and who carries each

The journal's conduct toward the agent is the states on its stack and the conducts folded into every state. Only a state moves the agent, and every line the journal says, holds or types is said by one listener: a state's own, a feature's conduct in every state, or the engine where no state may change it (delivering the user's messages, running commands, holding every tool while the context compacts, ending the session). This document is generated from the source: a state is its file, a line is a Nudge on its feature, and the sayer is the class and method that creates it.

## Every state, and who holds its conduct

| State | Title | Class | Extends | File | Answers | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| compacting | Compacting | Compacting | BaseState | journal/engine/states/compacting.py | tool_starting, prompt_submitted, stop, session_started | The context is being compacted, until the agent shows it is not: the session starting again, a tool call, a prompt or a stop pops it and hands that event to the state beneath; every journal start pops it too. |
| void | Not at work | Void | BaseState | journal/engine/states/void.py | tool_starting, helper_assignment | Every helper's floor, the bottom of its stack, never popped and never changed by a work mode: no feature's conduct reaches it, every tool but a journal command is refused with the jobless line, and the journal puts the helper to work by an assignment, which it answers by pushing the state the assignment carries. |
| delegating | Delegating a task | Delegating | Working | journal/features/workers/states/delegating.py | stop | A task in hand as the orchestrator: handed to a worker and its report reviewed, never done by the agent itself; a stop names the task to hand over and the open tasks to dispatch. |
| orchestrating | Orchestrating | Orchestrating | Idle | journal/features/workers/states/orchestrating.py | stop, ticked, worker_back | The orchestrator's floor: its task assigner, OrchestratorTaskAssigner, names the tasks to delegate in round robin over the running plans and starts none on the agent; a stop asks about the blocked tasks it can move, then names those tasks to dispatch, and a long quiet or a worker's report names the same; it pushes Orchestrating a plan and Delegating a task where the builder's floor pushes Following a plan and Working. |
| orchestrating_plan | Orchestrating a plan | OrchestratingPlan | FollowingPlan | journal/features/workers/states/orchestrating_plan.py | stop | Following a plan as the orchestrator: the task in hand is handed to a worker and its report reviewed, never done by the agent itself; a stop names the task to hand over and the open tasks to dispatch. |
| soloing | Working alone | Soloing | Idle | journal/features/workers/states/soloing.py | tool_starting | The solo floor: the agent does everything itself, and a worker's dispatch is refused. |
| ended | Ended | Ended | BaseState | journal/engine/states/ended.py | session_started, prompt_submitted, tool_starting, session_ended | The session is over: nothing is allowed and nothing is said until it shows it lives again, by starting, taking a prompt or using a tool; then it is popped. |
| demand_block | DemandBlock | Demand block | BaseState | journal/engine/states/demand_block.py | tool_starting | The agent let a demand's span run out: every tool in the demand's block scope is refused with its refusal until the requirement is met, and then it is popped. |
| panicking | Panicking | Held stops in a loop | BaseState | journal/engine/states/panicking.py | tool_starting, prompt_submitted | The agent's stop was held five times in a row with nothing between: no feature's conduct is heard, so the next stop goes through; the agent is asked to set its state with journal panic and file a report; a tool use or the user's message pops it. |
| sorting_dump | Sorting a dump | SortingDump | BaseState | journal/features/dumps/states/sorting_dump.py | idle, prompt_submitted, dump_arrived_dumps, dump_asked, dump_answered, dump_chosen, dump_filed | The agent files the dump the user dropped: the stop is held until every item is filed or failed, save while it waits on the user's answer; what arrives on the dump, the user's answer and the user's choice of a next step are typed to it; it pops when the dump is filed, told to sum it up, or moves on to the next dump waiting. |
| reading_overview | Reading the overview | ReadingOverview | BaseState | journal/features/briefing/states/reading_overview.py | session_started (after a compaction), tool_starting, overview_read | After a compaction the agent reads the overview before anything else: every tool use and every journal command is refused, but a read of a skill it owes and journal environment overview itself; it pops once the overview has run. |
| weighing_memories | Weighing memories | WeighingMemories | BaseState | journal/features/memory/states/weighing_memories.py | tool_starting, stop, context_decided, resume | At a mark of the context window the agent weighs its memories: writes wait and a stop is refused, reads and journal commands go through; journal memory add, weigh, remove or skip pops it, and so does the end of a compaction over it once the mark owed is cleared. |
| following_sequence | Following a sequence | FollowingSequence | BaseState | journal/features/sequences/states/following_sequence.py | resume, sequence_step_followed, sequence_step_finished, sequence_step_skipped, plan_reviewed, plan_readied, sequence_run_paused, sequence_run_abandoned, sequence_run_cancelled, sequence_run_cannot_finish, tool_starting, stop, session_started, ticked | A sequence in hand, pushed by the sequences conduct when a run starts or a new session takes one over, and popped when it ends, is abandoned, cancelled or cannot finish; one started inside another is pushed over it. Until its step is taken up a write or a run of anything but reads and journal commands waits, while a subagent's dispatch goes through; a step whose file edits wait refuses every write but the commands it lets through. A stop with the step open is refused with the step; a quiet agent is typed the step again; nothing while the run is paused, a question is open or the agent owes the journal something. |
| paused | Paused by you | PausedByUser | Wait | journal/features/pausing/states/paused_by_user.py | tool_starting, user_resumed | The user paused the agent from the viewer: every tool call but a read of the user's messages is held until the user resumes it, by the resume button, which pops it with the carry-on line, or by writing to it; a stop goes through, so a message left meanwhile never deadlocks the agent between the hold and the stop. |
| limited | Usage limit reached | UsageLimited | Wait | journal/features/usage/states/usage_limited.py | ticked, message_arrived, turn_failed | The agent's provider refused its turns on a usage limit: the journal types nothing into its terminal, a message from the user pops it with the inbox line so the message is typed at once, and every so many minutes (usage.check_minutes) it pops to try a turn, which pushes it again while the limit holds. |
| following_plan | Following a plan | FollowingPlan | Working | journal/features/plans/states/following_plan.py | stop, session_started, tool_starting, task_started, task_closed, plan_done, plan_postponed, plan_abandoned | Working with a plan in hand, for the plan's whole life. Its task assigner, PlanTaskAssigner, starts the plan's next task when the task in hand closes and the state keeps the top as that task. At a checkpoint the state has no task in hand: the stop waits for the user, or in auto mode is refused and the agent told to go on. Popped when the plan is done, postponed or abandoned, and on resume when the plan is no longer the one started here. |
| naming_test_commands | Naming the test commands | NamingTestCommands | BaseState | journal/features/plans/states/naming_test_commands.py | push, tool_starting, stop, task_closed, plan_postponed, plan_abandoned, plan_finished | Pushed over the plan's task when it starts while the setting plans.test_commands is empty. Its push tells the agent to name the project's test commands with journal settings set; reads and journal commands go through, every other tool and a stop are held with that line. It leaves once the setting holds a line, and hands its task's close and the plan's pause, cancel or end down to the plan state beneath. |
| waiting | Waiting on a question | Waiting | Wait | journal/features/questions/states/waiting.py | question_answered | The agent asked the user something. Idle is fine; the answer pops it and names the question to read, a prompt from the user is the answer in other words, and beneath another state it pops on resume once its question is answered. Pushed by the questions conduct on QuestionPosed. |
| awaiting | Waiting | Awaiting | Wait | journal/features/tasks/states/awaiting.py | tool_starting, ticked, row_settled, worker_dispatched_workers, worker_back_workers, worker_stopped_workers | The agent waits on something outside its hands, named in words and by the rows that end it, table:id each: workers, outputs, checks, tasks or questions. Each row settling is told and the last pops the wait with what each came to. A wait on workers stands through the agent's own tool use, since it works on meanwhile and is widened by each dispatch; any other wait is lifted when the agent works again. Stopping is fine; in auto mode the next task is named once after a minute, and every five quiet minutes the agent is asked to look. |
| choosing_paused_work | Choosing paused work | ChoosingPausedWork | BaseState | journal/features/tasks/states/choosing_paused_work.py | resume, task_started, plan_started, paused_work_declined, stop, session_started, setting_changed (workers conduct) | Pushed by the idle floor at a stop in auto mode when paused work the agent may take up waits beside an open task: it asks which to take up and holds nothing but the stop, twice at most, after which the floor's assigner takes the first paused task up. It names no assigner, so the floor's keeps assigning beneath it. It ends when the agent starts a task or a plan, which go down to the floor, when the agent runs journal task skip-paused or the user's own words come, when nothing is left to choose, or when the work mode switches. |
| idle | Idle | Idle | AgentState | journal/features/tasks/states/idle.py | session_started, task_started, plan_started, prompt_submitted, tool_starting, stop, ticked | Nothing in hand: the floor of the stack, never popped. Its task assigner (DefaultTaskAssigner, PlanStartTaskAssigner with plans) starts the next task at a stop in auto mode: the agent's own paused task whose wait ended, an approved plan, then the first open task, held back while paused work it may choose is as urgent. A stop with paused work the agent may take up beside an open task pushes the choice of paused work; otherwise a stop here is held only by paused tasks and by a blocked task whose check cannot run. The quiet is measured from the agent's last doing. |
| stuck | Stuck | Stuck | Wait | journal/features/tasks/states/stuck.py |  | The agent said it is truly stuck. Nothing is said until it works again or the user speaks: its own next tool use or a word from the user pops it. |
| working | Working | Working | AgentState | journal/features/tasks/states/working.py | tool_starting, stop, session_started, prompt_submitted, ticked, task_logged, task_closed, task_started, plan_started | On one task. Writes are counted since the last log line: after the first N the log is asked for, every M the task is named back, and past the limit the next write waits for the log line. A stop with the task in hand is told to carry on, with the log line first when it is old; a session resumed with it is told where it stands; a quiet quarter hour is told it is still open. Pushed by journal task start, popped by done and pause. |
| working_task | At work on its task | WorkingTask | BaseState | journal/features/workers/states/working_task.py | tool_starting, stop, command_ended, wait_request, impasse_report, task_closed, worker_delivered, worker_review_requested | A worker at work on its task, pushed over Void when it clocks in: its writes wait while the journal rebases its worktree, it never runs git, it runs tests only as the setting says, its stop waits for an output of its own still running and is told the to-do items still open, it is told the end of each of its outputs, its own journal await and journal stuck push the wait and the stuck state over its work, and it pops back to Void when its work is delivered, sent to review, or its task is closed by the user. |
| researching | Researching | Researching | BaseState | journal/features/workers/states/researching.py | subagent_ended | A Claude Code subagent at work on its own row (its main session and agent id), over Void from its start: its tool uses are answered and recorded as its own, never the main agent's, and its end pops it back to Void before the row ends. |
| verifying | Verifying a dismissal | Verifying | BaseState | journal/features/verification/states/verifying.py | tool_starting, reader_report_judged | The verifier the journal sends to judge a dismissed reader report: every tool but its verdict is refused and no feature's conduct reaches it, so it cannot leave; its verdict ends its session. |
| reviewing | Reviewing a worker's work | Reviewing | BaseState | journal/features/reviewing/states/reviewing.py | tool_starting, stop, worker_reviewed | The reviewer the journal sends, in orchestrator mode with the reviewer on, to review a clocked-out worker's work: it reads and runs the tests, but every file edit is refused, a stop is refused until it gives its report with journal review, and no feature's conduct reaches it, so it cannot leave; its report ends its session. |

## Every line, by feature

One row per line the journal may say: the feature, the nudge key, its words with their values in braces, and the listeners that say it; a line with no sayer is said by a command's output or kept for a state to come.

## Kept in code, by design

- Delivering the user's messages to the agent (DeliverMessage, TellInbox), running the agent's commands, the shell runner and its limits, holding every tool while the context compacts (Compacting), ending a session (Ended) and the one session per environment rule are the engine's: no state may change them.
- What the agent owes the journal, the journal skill to read, the look at what is in flight and the decision at a context mark, is a fact on its row set by a feature's recording listener and held by that feature's conduct; SkillRead, LookTaken and MarkDecided pay the debt.
- The replays under tests/replays are the record of what the states say; a record is re-frozen only where the conduct changed on purpose, with the reason in the task that changed it.
