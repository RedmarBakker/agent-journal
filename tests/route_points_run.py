"""Outside the default run, since it loads the saved full project: the commit gate runs it before each commit. Every route the server registers, each list with its list parameters, every hook kind as the agent orchestrates, the commands an agent runs on its plan and those it runs as its session starts, and a settings save of a whole group, are generated from the router, the hook kinds and the saved full project (tests/full_project.py) and answered in-process against it, counting points, not time: a row loaded, a write and a started kilobyte loaded are a point each, and any answer over its 30 points fails the run, whatever the machine is doing. An answer a live journal gives after the rows it reads were written is counted against a cold cache, as it is there: a hook, a list's change read, a read the viewer polls, a list it reads whole as a page opens and a command run as a session starts."""
